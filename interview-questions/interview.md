# Interview Experience in Mediusware

## Round 1: Online Test


## Round 2: Technical Interview

- **Basic Test**
We were given a trello like board with a list of tasks and we were asked to implement a feature to move tasks from any one column to a completion column. We would also be able to rename any column as completion column. we can move any task to the completion column and it would add a timestamp to the task which would not be editable. We were asked basic questions about the task.

- **Technical Viva**
I was asked questions about data structures and algorithms, linear and non-linear data structure, examples of non-linear data structure, difference between trees and graphs, tree traversal algorithms, binary tree, bfs and dfs, how they work, shortest path algorithm, backtracking.

Then I was asked about the current technologies I work with(JavaScript). What is an event loop, what happens when an async function enters an event loop.

I was also asked about OOP. what are some examples of polymorphism and encapsulation in JavaScript.
